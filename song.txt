Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feeling lit, feeling light, 2 A.M., summer night
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uh-uh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel
Life for me is just weed and brews
See the hoes flock to you when your name is Q
Am I over-faded? Hell yeah it's true
Turn a beat on, ain't no limit to what I can do
See this Top Dawg in heat, but I'mma fuck the world
I'mma be on tunes 'til God re-furls
You sat me down, I'm still tryna get higher
You looked at me stupid when I twisted the fire
Meanwhile my nigga drunk as fuck
A nigga fucked up, we all fucked up
You done fucked up, I brought more blunts
Smoke back to up, you niggas know what's up
Too damn high, can't stand myself
I love drunk driving, man I'm something else
Heat on my side, you're more than welcome to melt
I'm 'bout to finish a pound, you're more welcome to help (ay)
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
Weed and brews, weed and brews
Life for me is just weed and brews
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
If fucked her once, then I could fuck her twice
Yeah, you heard me right, I might fuck tonight
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel, uhh, fuck that
Hands on the wheel
